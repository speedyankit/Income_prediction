I have just learn from https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction
So, The thing I have learn from this course-> module 1 is 
1. What is Machine Learning
2. Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
3. Supervised have Regression and Classification in type
4. Unsupervised have Clustering, Anomaly detection and dimensionality reduction
5. Linear Regression Model -> Terminology
6. Cost Function
7. Gradient Descent
   
   You can go to the main.ipynb file where in the last we can check the prediction of income according to the experience of user
   We use multiple_linear_regression_datatbase.csv here for data

I have also done module two and I have just know how to use scikit-learn by this I have done the things that I learn before I goes just so easy
